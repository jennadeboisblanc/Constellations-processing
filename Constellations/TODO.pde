tweet birthday to get your constellation (and a way to stand to create that constellation?)

What is the interplay between constellation body and strings moving?
Will the main constellation have to be another color in order for it to be obvious?

main constellation - what are the ranges of movement? Where / how will it be displayed?
body could just be an organic series of connections- prioritizes finding a node over finding a particular location

creating constellations in the constellations layers - do this after the string is set up?

each mode needs a corresponding panel mode

new person, new sequence; sequence could begin with a pose that sets the person's constellation
